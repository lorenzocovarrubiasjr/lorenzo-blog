We've all heard the story of how the tortoise beat the hare. It has echoed its teaching thru the halls of history and the people it has taught couldn't be counted. We've all heard of Thomas Edisons 10,000 failed attemps at creating the light bulb. Michael Jordans removal from his high school basketball team. Steve Jobs being fired from Apple. If you know the end of all these stories, there is one gem that each of these conquorers possessed. Determination.
